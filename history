Develop new plugins/helpers/functionality, reorganize helpers:

- Spun off into the Helpers module:
  - check_user (channel access)
  - natural_language
    - #time_diff_in_natural_language/#time_difference (turning a time range into a friendly format)
  - table_format (ASCII table generator)

- Develop new helper(s):
  - is_channel_disabled (bakes in per-plugin channel blacklists via mixins)

- Admin/Trusted user support:
  - Cinch::Admin 
    (provides mixed-in methods for checking against, adding, and deleting admins and trusted users in a Redis database. 
     Requires @bot.config.shared[:redis] that is an instance of the Redis client for Ruby.)
  - AdminToolbox (Provides admin-only functions for adding/deleting admins and trusted users, as well as getting lists and initially setting up admin access.)
  - Updated toolbox/privtoolbox/macros/authtest to account for the new system
  - remoteadmin updated to accomodate the new 'admin channel' concept.
  - Toolbox now allows graceful shutdown via SIGINT

Other plugin projects that are used in individual bots:
- CelestiaRadio::StreamInfo (Stream data for CR, listener number tracking per request, play history)
- CelestiaRadio::DJInfo ([s]needs to be spun off[/s] done.)
