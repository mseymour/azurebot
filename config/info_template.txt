# Currently, there are seven fields available:
# bot_name, owner_name, isadmin, cinch_version, uptime, session_start_date, plugins, ruby_version, ruby_platform, and ruby_release_date.
# All fields must be surrounded by '<>'.
# At some point, I will hopefully have some more to add. We'll see.

I am ![b]<bot_name>![b], and my owner is ![b]<owner_name>![b].
I am currently running ![b]Cinch <cinch_version>![b], a Ruby-based IRC framework, on Ruby <ruby_version>-<ruby_platform>.
I have been running for ![b]<uptime>![b].
I was started around ![b]<session_start_date>![b].
My loaded plugins are: <plugins>.
You are ![b]<is_admin>![b].
#If there's anything interesting that you would like to see me have, why not tell <owner_name>?
#You know, there are times that I wish I had a digi-mommy...
